Résumé
======
My résumé, for all those who wonder why they should hire me. This is secretly just an
exercise in fancy typography inspired by reading [*Practical Typography*](http://practicaltypography.com).

This works by generating HTML using Underscore templates. All data is kept in a giant almost-json object
which uses some extra helper methods to look suitably shiny (e.g. Bugzilla bug numbers link to their pages).
